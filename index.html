  <p> The semester got officially launched for adaptive design chapter at SLC with a workshop for interested volunteers.
  The initial workshop went over the concepts of cardboard carpentry and Arduino circuits.  Participants assembled a "Circle Time Bench"
under the direction of the student leaders and got the LED blink sketch up and running with the Arduino.  A button was added into the circuit
and the students plugged in a powerswitch tail to control a fan.</p>

<p>Today we went to Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center to present our prototypes to the recreational therapists, in order to get feedback on what steps we need to take next. Overall, the ideas we presented were well received, and we will continue to work on our previous projects: 1.) a set of adaptive stamps and stencils, 2.) an interactive story time board, and 3.) and a remote control car with drawing instruments attached (a.k.a "RC Car(t)). We also had a chance to visit the kids and see their space, which gave us a better sense of how to approach the building of equipment. We have developed a list of steps that need to be taken, and plan to delegate these out to group members next Sunday.  </p>
<p><b>Remote Control Car</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>switch adapt the car</li>
	<li>get another car with a different frequency</li>
	<li>find appropriate markers</li>
	<li>create boundary for the large sheet</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Story-Time Board</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>make a wired switch board to control the sensors</li>
	<li>fix the wireless sensors</li>
	<li>make at least 2 tables</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Stamps/Stencils</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>make smaller stamps with large press pads and shape specific</li>
	<li>research other sponge options, as well as thinner</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Location Sensor</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>create a remote to indicate where person is located by press of button</li>
	<li>or try to determine a way where it is marked by the location of the chair</li>
</ul>

<p> Students worked concurrently on a few different projects.  Initially, three students worked to debug 
the Wifi setup of the Raspberry Pi and Adafruit HUZZAH.  The two stopped communicating with each other and the team worked to determine how to add button input to the devices to communicate wirelessly.  
The other group worked to to figure out a stamping mechanism to provide an art and craft activity for the children at the center.  After getting their
respective project to a comfortable place, they took on a few other projects.  One group worked on continuing the wall for the remote control marker.
Another set looked at adding more functionality of the HUZZAH to control a fan.  A third individual started researching a 
new project utilizing a means to locate a child able to move from neighborhood to neighborhood.</p>

  <p> The semester got officially launched for adaptive design chapter at SLC with a workshop for interested volunteers.
  The initial workshop went over the concepts of cardboard carpentry and Arduino circuits.  Participants assembled a "Circle Time Bench"
under the direction of the student leaders and got the LED blink sketch up and running with the Arduino.  A button was added into the circuit
and the students plugged in a powerswitch tail to control a fan.</p>

<p>Today we went to Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center to present our prototypes to the recreational therapists, in order to get feedback on what steps we need to take next. Overall, the ideas we presented were well received, and we will continue to work on our previous projects: 1.) a set of adaptive stamps and stencils, 2.) an interactive story time board, and 3.) and a remote control car with drawing instruments attached (a.k.a "RC Car(t)). We also had a chance to visit the kids and see their space, which gave us a better sense of how to approach the building of equipment. We have developed a list of steps that need to be taken, and plan to delegate these out to group members next Sunday.  </p>
<p><b>Remote Control Car</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>switch adapt the car</li>
	<li>get another car with a different frequency</li>
	<li>find appropriate markers</li>
	<li>create boundary for the large sheet</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Story-Time Board</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>make a wired switch board to control the sensors</li>
	<li>fix the wireless sensors</li>
	<li>make at least 2 tables</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Stamps/Stencils</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>make smaller stamps with large press pads and shape specific</li>
	<li>research other sponge options, as well as thinner</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Location Sensor</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>create a remote to indicate where person is located by press of button</li>
	<li>or try to determine a way where it is marked by the location of the chair</li>
</ul>

  <h3>September 11, 2016</h3>
  <p> The semester got officially launched for adaptive design chapter at SLC with a workshop for interested volunteers.
  The initial workshop went over the concepts of cardboard carpentry and Arduino circuits.  Participants assembled a "Circle Time Bench"
under the direction of the student leaders and got the LED blink sketch up and running with the Arduino.  A button was added into the circuit
and the students plugged in a powerswitch tail to control a fan.</p>

<h3>September 25, 2016</h3>
<p>Today we went to Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center to present our prototypes to the recreational therapists, in order to get feedback on what steps we need to take next. Overall, the ideas we presented were well received, and we will continue to work on our previous projects: 1.) a set of adaptive stamps and stencils, 2.) an interactive story time board, and 3.) and a remote control car with drawing instruments attached (a.k.a "RC Car(t)). We also had a chance to visit the kids and see their space, which gave us a better sense of how to approach the building of equipment. We have developed a list of steps that need to be taken, and plan to delegate these out to group members next Sunday.  </p>
<p><b>Remote Control Car</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>switch adapt the car</li>
	<li>get another car with a different frequency</li>
	<li>find appropriate markers</li>
	<li>create boundary for the large sheet</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Story-Time Board</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>make a wired switch board to control the sensors</li>
	<li>fix the wireless sensors</li>
	<li>make at least 2 tables</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Stamps/Stencils</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>make smaller stamps with large press pads and shape specific</li>
	<li>research other sponge options, as well as thinner</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Location Sensor</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>create a remote to indicate where person is located by press of button</li>
	<li>or try to determine a way where it is marked by the location of the chair</li>
</ul>

<h3>October 9, 2016</h3>
<p> Students worked concurrently on a few different projects.  Initially, three students worked to debug 
the Wifi setup of the Raspberry Pi and Adafruit HUZZAH.  The two stopped communicating with each other and the team worked to determine how to add button input to the devices to communicate wirelessly.  
The other group worked to to figure out a stamping mechanism to provide an art and craft activity for the children at the center.  After getting their
respective project to a comfortable place, they took on a few other projects.  One group worked on continuing the wall for the remote control marker.
Another set looked at adding more functionality of the HUZZAH to control a fan.  A third individual started researching a 
new project utilizing a means to locate a child able to move from neighborhood to neighborhood.</p>

<h3>October 23, 2016</h3>
<p>The students worked to push forward the projects, working on a stenciling block for arts and crafts, a boardering wall to contain the remote control pen, and tables for the sensory stations for reading time.
A list of supplies was compiled and ordered for finishing up the iterations of the projects.  Together we were going to determine if it would be possible to go into the center on November 6.
	</p>

	<h3>November 6, 2016</h3>
	<p> After the group spent the last week edging the sensory tables, they felt they needed a bit more time before presenting the next
		iteration of the project to the therapist.
		
	<ul>
		<li>Location Identifier: Need to tie the project to the strongest WiFi signal and begin looking at building a websiet to report the results</li>
		<li>Stamps: Make another stamp so that wheel chair has two side of the stamps</li>
		<li>pi: Looking for HDMI cable or TV with HDMI capabilities</li>
		<li>pi(2): Set up the pi, ie put OS into sd card</li>
		<li>Car: Maybe try out the 'infrared stuff' (Beck, 2016)</li>
		<li>Pi(3): layout the circuit for the Pi on the Breadboard to double check</li>
	</ul>

	<h3> November 13, 2016 </h3>
	<p> We worked on the website and arduino code for our location tracker service,	as well as duplicated the raspberry pi code
		so that we could later work to build other story time units.
	<h3>November 20, 2016</h3>
	<p> Today we worked on carving the adaptive stamp, began to reconstruct the breadboard for the story time unit, edged the border for the car,
		and worked on coding the location tracker. </p>

	<h3> December 4, 2016</h3>
	<p> Today we finished carving the prototype of the adaptive stamp / stencil, and also switch-adapted the toy car.
		To adapt the toy car, we used a receiver to measure the frequency of the control. We then copied this frequency,
		and created a secondary switch using this copy. This was done using open source code available online. 
	        Next week we plan on testing the stamp proto-type and soldering the second switch so that it becomes permanent. </p>

	<h3> Feb 12, 2016> </h3>
	<p> Today the group split in two and worked on two separate projects. We continued working on replicating the consoles. 
		We also continued working on getting the remote control to work independently and adaptively. Next time we plan on 
		working on the software side of the raspberry pi and building a housing unit for the remote control.

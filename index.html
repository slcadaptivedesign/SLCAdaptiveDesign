  <p> The semester got officially launched for adaptive design chapter at SLC with a workshop for interested volunteers.
  The initial workshop went over the concepts of cardboard carpentry and Arduino circuits.  Participants assembled a "Circle Time Bench"
under the direction of the student leaders and got the LED blink sketch up and running with the Arduino.  A button was added into the circuit
and the students plugged in a powerswitch tail to control a fan.</p>
